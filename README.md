# Mobility Management

### Steering and differential design
We have a differential in the back of our robot to make turns smoother. If robot turns one wheel will move slower than second and it reduces radius of the turn so our robot can turn more accurately. Our robot is controlled by steering and differantial mechs.

### Weight distribution
  Our robot weight is  a little behind the center so our robot has road grip and it doesn't slide.



  
### Camera position
  Our camera is positioned as high and far back as possible to enhance the view and manage obstacles effectively. It is also tilted slightly downward to monitor nearby blocks and improve obstacle handling.



  
### Motor selection
  We have a choice between 2 types of LEGO motors: large motor and medium motor, the large motor is powerful but the speed is lower, the medium motor is not that powerful but have a great speed. Because the category needs speed not power, we chose that it would be better tochoose the medium motor type.
  We thought that the mobilithe tahat 1 motor gives us may not be enough so we combined 2 with a differential.

# Power and Sense Management
## Power management </br>
  The power source of our robot is the <a href="#">EV3 Programmable Brick</a>, it has a rechargable 10V Lithium Battery. EV3 P-Brick have 4 ports for motors and 4 ports for sensors. For the power consumption of motors and sensors: <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/ev3-current-consumption-measurement/">https://www.dexterindustries.com/ev3-current-consumption-measurement/</a>.

## Sense Management
  We used the ultrasonic, color and gyro sensors of the LEGO EDUCATION MINDSTORMS EV3 Core Set for the sense management of the robot.

  The ultrasonic sensors we used are very important on our open round codes to find the middle of the walls and stay there.
  Our gyro sensor is helping us calculate the error of the robots placement and fixing it.
  The color sensors help us make the turns to finish the track and determine which way we are going to go.

# Obstacle Management
To go around the obstacles, know their x and y coordinates and know which color the obstacle is we used the PixyCam. The code uses the x and y coordinates of the obstacle according to where it is placed on the cam and the color learning ability helps us with the paths the robot should take.

# Engineering Factors
### Building The Robot
 We built the robot with LEGO. For the motors, sensors and the EV3 programmable brick we used the LEGO MINDSTORMS set. For the rest of the robot we combined LEGO MINDSTORMS set with LEGO Spike Prime set.

 To process the colors of the obstacles we used the PixyCam. The camera is a powerful tool with I2C communication protocol. It can distinguish the colors and sizes of the obstacles. It also has a program (PixyMon v2) for the config of the Cam.







### Coding The Robot
  For the code we used <a href="">LEGO MINDSTORMS</a> application.
